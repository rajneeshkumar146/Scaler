    <div class="box scrollable">Chandrayaan-3 (/ˌtʃʌndrəˈjɑːn/ CHUN-drə-YAHN) is the third mission in the Chandrayaan
        programme, a
        series of lunar-exploration missions developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).[7] Launched on
        14 July 2023, the mission consists of a lunar lander named Vikram and a lunar rover named Pragyan, similar to
        those launched aboard Chandrayaan-2 in 2019.</div>
    <div class="box scrollable">"Chandrayaan-3 was launched from Satish Dhawan</div>
    <div class="box auto">The Vikram lander and Pragyan rover were set to sleep on 2 September and 4 September respectively
        due to
        depleting solar power with sunset at the landing site. The lander and rover are planned to start working again
        at local sunrise on September 22.</div>
